# ngs-scripts-hub
A collection of simple and easy to use scripts for extracting useful information from FastQ, SAM and VCF files.

FastQC and MultiQC already do fantastic jobs at providing in-depth analysis for those types of files. As part of a Functional Genomics course, the purpose of these scripts was rather to better understand the file structures and learning how to manipulate them to extract meaningful information from them.

# How to Use

After downloading the desired script, execute by giving your `.fastq`, `.sam` or `.vcf` file as an argument. Here's an example:

```
avgDepth.sh snps.vcf
```
